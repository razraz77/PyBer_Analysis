# PyBer_Analysis
Purpose:

The Purpose of this Analysis was to detrimine the total amount of fares($USD) genereated by PyBer based on the type of city (Urban, Rural or Suburban) that the fares were collected in.

Results:

As can be seen in the multi line graph, there is unsurprisingly more ride-share activity over all in more urban areas and less in more rural areas. The variance also seems to be fairly similar, indicating a similar effect of the date on all city types.Theres is also an overall uptake in usuage during the summer months as opposed to winter months.

Summary:

It canbe concluded that urban areas are deffinatly favourable for buisness and diminishing as cities become more rural. It is also recomended that there are more avalible rides in the summer months as that is when people seem to be using PyBer the most.
